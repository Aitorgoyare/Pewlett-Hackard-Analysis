# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age

## Results: 
Retirement Titles table for employees who are born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955

## Summary: 
On the basis of the results of my analysis, Pewlett Hackard about 90,398 people may retire leaving vacant positions throughout the company. Pewlett Hackard will face a large shortfall once the majority of eligible employees retire. The pool of employees eligible for mentoring will play an important role in hiring new employees, first because of the large number of eligible retirees who will not pass on their knowledge to new employees but will be mentored. And secondly, because the employees who will take on the mentoring will be able to help Pewlett Hackard address the employee shortage in the event that those who can retire all retire at the same time.
